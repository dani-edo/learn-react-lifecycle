## Learn React Lifecycle

In this project I learned how to work React Lifecycle.
First, I create a base class component that I put in `index.js`. There I called several component functions namely `Display.js` and` Spinner.js`, each of which has their respective roles. `Spinner.js` to display the loading page,` Display.js` to display pages with themes that adjust to the current season. Season data is obtained from the location (from geolocation) and current month.
